## Comparison Matrix in Markdown


We suggest to click through to the [master spreadsheet in google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nRqjnD7SCMJGmYR2gdZJ84YolLnHAMJwjSG7z7VcM6c/edit?usp=sharing). But if that doesn't work for you then here is a markdown alternative. You may need to use the scrollbar at the bottom in order to scroll right.
