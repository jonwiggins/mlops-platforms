# MLOps Platforms

## What This Is

This is a resource for understanding and evaluating MLOps platforms. If you're wondering how to evaluate MLOps platforms, see the [Thoughtworks Guide (COMING SOON!)](#). If you know how to evaluate MLOps platforms and want some materials, read on.

## Format

We provide an open format of categories and have links to vendor documentation within cells to highlight features. This lets vendors do things their own ways and helps readers find the detail they need.

## Platform Concepts Intros

In addition to the comparison matrix in the next section, we provide short marketing-free introductions to key concepts of some of the platforms. This provides context to make sense of the features in the matrix.

- [AWS Sagemaker](AWS_Google_Azure.md#amazon), [Google Vertex](AWS_Google_Azure.md#google) and [Microsoft Azure ML](AWS_Google_Azure.md#azure)
- [Databricks](Dataiku_Databricks_h2o.md#databricks-lakehouse-platform), [Dataiku](Dataiku_Databricks_h2o.md#dataiku) and [h2o](Dataiku_Databricks_h2o.md#h2oai)
- [kubeflow](kubeflow_mlflow.md#kubelfow) and [mlflow](kubeflow_mlflow.md#mlflow)
